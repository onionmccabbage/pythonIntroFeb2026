## Python Review 3 (1 hr 20 min until 3:00)

- Alter these instructions to suit your thinking
- Aim for good architecture (maybe use separate modules, remember 'if __name__...')
- Look online, talk to each other, ask me etc.
- There will be an opportunity to share your code

Write a 'Weather' class with get/set methods for:
  'city', 'temperature' and 'description'
(remember: you will also need __init__ )

Your class should validate:
  - the value for 'city' is a non-empty string of three or more characters 
    (e.g. if type(city)== str and len(city)>2:)
  - if city is missing or unacceptable, you should provide a sensible default 
    (e.g. 'Athlone')
  - 'temperature' needs to be a numeric (int or float) value between -70 and 90
  - 'description' must be a string, but it may be an empty string
  - decide if you will raise a TypeError or set a default for description and temperature 

If you like, in your Weather class override __str__ so the class prints nicely,
something like 'The weather in Athlone is cloudy at 12 degrees celcius'

You might choose to implement __slots__ for your class

Exercise the code by making instances of your Weather class with suitable values

### If Time

Persist the values from the weather instance to a text file 
You could include a timestamp in this text file (use datetime)
Also provide a mechanism to read back the weather reports from the text file
