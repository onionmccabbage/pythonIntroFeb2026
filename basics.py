# this is a Python module
# it contains text which will be run when we execute this module

# declre variables to contain data
a = 2   # an integer
b = 7.3 # a floating point number

print(a, b)
print(type(a), type(b)) # we can see what type of data we have

# we may carry out maths operations
d = a+b
e = b-a
# we also have * /
# % will return...
print(b%a) # this return the remainder after division (in this case to a high precision)
print(b//a) # this returns the whole number of divisors (modulo)
print(2**3) # ** will raise to the power
